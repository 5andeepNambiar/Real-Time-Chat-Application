# Real-Time Chat App

A real-time chat application that allows users to create and join chat rooms using unique room IDs. Users can seamlessly send and receive messages within the chat rooms and view a list of active users. The app employs advanced features like message history to ensure the continuity of the chat, even if users leave and rejoin.

## Features

1. **Create/Join Chat Rooms:** Users can create or join chat rooms by entering a unique room ID, facilitating personalized and secure communication.

2. **Real-Time Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages in real-time, ensuring a dynamic and interactive chat experience.

3. **Active User List:** The app displays a list of active users in the chat room, promoting transparency and community engagement.

4. **Message History :** An optional feature to implement message history ensures that the chat persists, even if a user leaves and rejoins the chat room.

## Key Focus

1. **Behavioral Pattern (Observer Pattern):** The application utilizes the Observer Pattern to notify clients of new messages or user activities, enhancing the responsiveness of the chat.

2. **Creational Pattern (Singleton):** A Singleton pattern is employed to manage the state of the chat rooms efficiently, ensuring a unified and controlled environment.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The principles of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance are effectively applied, contributing to the robustness and maintainability of the codebase.

## Behavioral Pattern

The Observer Pattern is implemented to notify clients in real-time about new messages or user activities, enhancing the responsiveness and interactivity of the chat.

## Creational Pattern

The Singleton pattern is employed to manage the state of chat rooms, ensuring a single and controlled instance for efficient coordination and state management.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is applied to group related functionalities together, protecting the internal state of objects and promoting modular design.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is utilized to allow objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling flexibility and extensibility in the codebase.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is leveraged to create a hierarchy of classes, promoting code reuse and ensuring a structured and organized class hierarchy.
